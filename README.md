# Ruby Environment Script

#### _Ben Williams_

## Description
This script establishes an environment Ruby (2.4.0) on Rails (4.1.3) for Debian 8. It downloads several gems to assist with connecting to a MYSQL server. Running the script will download NODE.js and RVM. RVM will then install Ruby and Rails. Dependencies and Gems are handled automatically. This script is currently written with "RHapi" as the name of the rails application. Change "RHapi" to a corresponding application in the root database for personal usage.
